Urban areas boasts 80% of the drivers in the company, but also have the lowest average fares per ride.
Rural areas have the highest fares with the lowest number of drivers.  This means despite having the least total number of rides,
rural cities have the highest fares per driver.

## Summary: 
### Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
If the goal is to create more equality in outcome for the three city types these are my recommendations:

- increase fares in the Urban areas, to improve the average fare per driver.
- Focus on recruiting more drivers in rural areas, to help get fare prices down
- Encourage more urban drivers to work in suburban areas, to better balance the ride availability.
